      "content": "JERSEY CITY - Updated renderings reveal Harborside 8 and Harborside 9, a two-skyscraper mixed-use project in Jersey City, New Jersey. Designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects and developed by Veris Residential, formerly known as Mack-Cali Realty Corp., the project consists of the 68-story, 680-unit Harborside 8 and the 57-story, 579-unit Harborside 9. The latter gained approval from the Jersey City Planning Board and will stand 607 feet tall and rise from an 8-story podium. The property is currently occupied by a 169,000-square-foot open-air parking lot bound by 2nd Street to the north, Harborside Place to the south, Hudson Street to the west, and the 18-story 3 Second Street at Harborside office tower immediately to the east.\n\nAerial and street level views preview the scope and appearance of the skyscrapers and their glass curtain walls. The buildings have a mirrored symmetrical design with alternating expanses of reflective glass and sections with mullions dividing the panels in two- to three-story grids. The ground floors feature metal paneling and Harborside 9\u2019s multi-story podium has a contrasting fenestration with gray paneling and rectangular windows.\n\nHarborside 9\u2019s residential inventory will consist of 96 studios, 376 one-bedrooms, 166 two-bedrooms, and ten three-bedroom units. The building will include also a 15-percent affordable housing component with 87 units in compliance with Jersey City\u2019s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (IZO), which wasn\u2019t in effect when the Harborside 8 tower gained approval by the Jersey City Planning Board in 2020.\n\nAlongside the residential component will be 14,840 square feet of commercial space across Harborside 9\u2019s ground floor, 300 bicycle parking spots, a new east-west vehicular roadway cutting through the middle of the parcel, as well as an enclosed parking garage with 555 spaces, 300 of which will be for the use of Harborside 10\u2019s office workers to compensate for the loss of their parking lot.\n\nAmenities at Harborside 9 will sit on the 9th floor and include a pickleball court, indoor fitness areas, a game room, coworking space, and an outdoor deck featuring a pool.\n\nNo construction timeline has been announced yet.",
